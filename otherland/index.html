<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<p>This is a puzzle-based game that takes place entirely via text I/O and player-choice path selection. By making the objective collecting various objects which can be found only in specific locations, the player can explore the world and exercise their mind with word puzzles, riddles, and puns.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<p>Player choices initiate changes in variable state, whether that be the color scheme based on the in-game location, the variable values of in-game collectibles, or whether certain options are available.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<p>I learned more about constructing a non-linear storyline with conditional branching, collectibles, and I/O. The most difficult part was learning Twine's pseudo-language and applying it to specific tasks that are far simpler to implement in a more advanced coding language.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>I had no assets; only text.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<p>No other games are referenced, though the mechanics are similar to my previous digital assignments 3 and 4.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<p>You are exploring an Alice in Wonderland-esque world when you are challenged to gather the materials for a tea party, but in order to get those ingredients, you must undergo a series of trials.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<p>I used teapot, though "making a sandwich" was originally also going to be included.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<p>Input: keyboard and mouse. Randomness: random number generation. Genre: puzzle, text-based, choose-your-own-adventure. Play style: point and click, word/phrase typing. </p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<p>Implementation of theme changes, variable-tracking, and goal-achievement.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<p>Anyone who enjoys the universe of Alice in Wonderland will enjoy the whimsey of the strange characters. People who like riddles and word puzzles will enjoy the puzzles. People who like reading will be immersed in the story more fully than if it were simple text.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<p>A player is given a list of items needed for a tea party. By clicking on options and typing in answers, the player advances through the game until either all necessary items are collected OR the player gives up. Future iterations would have background images instead of solid-color backgrounds, music which varies based on the in-game location, and a constant variable display.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<p>Players will attempt to go through each available story option in order to unlock as many of the objects as possible. However, not every path gives objects and certain paths give more than one object.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<p>You find yourself suddenly in the whimsical world of Otherland, a place that seems to be creating itself as you explore. In order to be welcomed, officially, you are required to gather all the necessary components for a tea party. By solving riddles, unscrambling anagrams, and exploring labyrinthine buildings, you'll collect the necessary supplies and then throw the party.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<p>Mostly readers. People who care more for story than gameplay. It's simple and easy to follow.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<p>No more than 10 minutes for a slow reader.</p>
</li>
