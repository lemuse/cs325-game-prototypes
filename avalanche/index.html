<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<p>It's a text-based adventure with random-chance generation. There are periods in the game where sheer randomness determine's the player's fate. This was once again made with Twine, though I have since downloaded the desktop version and am, therefore, able to save my work. (And, in the future, add sound effects and pictures.)</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<p>The incorporation of randomness and the game's tracking and return of variables at specific points during gameplay - such as whether it's day or night, which day/night it is, and how many meals you have left.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
<p>I learned more about using Twine - namely how the conditional branching, randomness, and variables can be utilized to create a more "organic" game.</p>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<p>Writing the story itself.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>No assets were harmed in the making of this prototype.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<p>Similar to my previous game, <a href="http://lemuse.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/stargazer/Stargazer.html">Stargazer</a></p>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<p>You're a veteran mountain climber trying out a new mountain without your usual climbing partner. Because climbing in real life is a careful balance of luck and skill, sometimes you can get very unlucky.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<p>Gambler (ie. the aspect of randomness) and ice (ie. the setting)</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<p>Input is entirely click-based. Genre is text-based choose your own adventure.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<p>This game evaluates the gameplay and technical prowess with added variables and branching when compared with earlier iterations (such as Stargazer from last week).</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<p>I want players to be relaxed because the gameplay is really simple, but also engaged in the story since it acts like an interactive novel. The ending should be unpredictable because of the elements of randomness, and players cannot plan to counteract specific outcomes because of this.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<p>Players may choose different paths during the course of the game. Different choices may affect variables differently (ie. choosing to camp for the night will increase the day counter and decrease food stores). A future iteration of this story would include consequences for exceeding the allotted time or food amounts as well as music and/or sound effects.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<p>With the addition of randomness, a strategy would not necessarily assist a player in succeeding.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<p>The game is set in our world, with the main character being an avid mountain climber. Because the character has climbed before, the setting and plot fit with his goals. Other characters may tempt the main character to take longer to achieve his goal, but they are not necessarily relevant to the plot. However, with the addition of a day-count, the passing of time puts pressure on the player to achieve the goal before the 7th day is reached. Any delay (by camping) may need to be avoided in order to make the goal during the provided window.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<p>People who enjoy reading or the idea of an interactive novel.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<p>Less than five minutes.</p>
</li>
