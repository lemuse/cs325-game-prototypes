<h2>Crystal Collector</h2>

<ul>
<li>Version 1.3</li>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A rudimentary "collection" system, like the given example, but with the added hitch of crystals potentially getting stuck.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Crystal Collector combines the "getting started" tutorial with an example to make the game slightly more complicated (ie. by adding the "rocks").
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
Setting sprites and objects in the game setting is very exacting and requires consideration (or, in my case, randomization)
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
Dumbing down my initial ideas; I was trying to do something way more complicated than my knowledge base and experience. Maybe later in the semester!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<li><a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/move-towards-object">Phaser Example: Move Towards Object</a></li>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You're an aspiring geologist with a stroke of luck: all the interesting rocks flock right to where you click - as long as you can maneuver around the boring rocks.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Geologist.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse-click and cursor movement.
Randomness: Crystals and Rocks are randomly generated on different areas of the game screen.
Genre: Resource gathering.
Play style: Point and click.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype evaluates the kinesthetics of the game; how easily (or not) the crystals are maneuvered around the rocks and how character movement works in the environment.
Edit: The character was so awkward, she had to be removed.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to, for once, not really have to work for their success. All they have to do is hold down the mouse and victory comes right to them - unlike in any other game, ever.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can hold down the mouse to attract crystals towards the mouse cursor. In order to gather all the crystals, the player will have to move the cursor so that any crystals stuck against the rocks will come loose. In a finalized version, the crystals would "disappear" upon collection, and there would be some type of counter to keep track of how many crystals you have. The finalized version might also have a character to move around.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will probably have the most success by simply holding down the mouse button at all times and moving the cursor around to collect all stray crystals.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player is an amateur geologist (basically, they just like pretty rocks and the idea of calling themself a geologist). On their first endeavor to collect crystals to study, they discover that they have a strange ability: with a little focus, they can draw all the crystals in the area to them like magnetism. However, pesky boulders can interrupt their field of influence and they have to move around them to collect all the available crystals. There isn't much in terms of dramatic tension, but the snagging of crystals on the rocks will encourage players to move the cursor around to collect them all.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This would cater to children with motor disabilities, who would enjoy the bright colors and the concept of having superpowers. A further iteration of the game might be adapted for educational purposes with different kinds of crystals for classification.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Seconds to minutes, at most, though technically infinite because there is no collection mechanism.
</li>
