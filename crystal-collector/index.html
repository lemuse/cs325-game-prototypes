<h2>Crystal Collector</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A rudimentary "collection" system, like the given example, but with the added hitch of crystals potentially getting stuck.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Crystal Collector combines the given code for the Phaser logo with an example as well as the "getting started" tutorial to make
the game slightly more complicated (ie. by adding the "rocks").
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
Setting sprites and objects in the game setting is very exacting and requires consideration (or, in my case, randomization)
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
Dumbing down my initial ideas; I was trying to do something way more complicated than my knowledge base and experience. Maybe later in the semester!
</li>

Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.

</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You're an aspiring geologist with a stroke of luck: all the interesting rocks flock right to you - as long as you can maneuver around the boring rocks.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Geologist.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse-click and cursor movement.
Randomness: Crystals and Rocks are randomly generated on different areas of the game screen.
Genre: Resource gathering.
Play style: Point and click.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype evaluates the kinesthetics of the game; how easily (or not) the crystals are maneuvered around the rocks and how character movement works in the environment.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to, for once, not really have to work for their success. All they have to do is hold down the mouse and victory comes right to them - unlike in any other game, ever.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move the character with the mouse cursor, and hold down the mouse to attract crystals towards the character. In order to gather all the crystals, the player will have to move the character so that any crystals stuck against the rocks will come loose. In a finalized version, the crystals would "disappear" upon collection, and there would be some type of counter to keep track of how many crystals you have.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will probably have the move success by simply holding down the mouse button at all times and moving the cursor around to collect all stray crystals.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The character is an amateur geologist (basically, she just likes pretty rocks and the idea of calling herself a geologist). On her first endeavor to collect crystals to study, she discovers that she has a strange ability: with a little focus, she can draw all the crystals in the area to her like magnetism. However, pesky boulders can interrupt her field of influence and she has to move around them to collect all the available crystals. There isn't much in terms of dramatic tension, but the snagging of crystals on the rocks will encourage players to move the geologist around to collect them all.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This would cater to children with motor disabilities, who would enjoy the bright colors and the young-looking character with seemingly magical powers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Seconds to minutes, at most, though technically infinite because there is no collection mechanism.
</li>
